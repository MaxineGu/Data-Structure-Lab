This zip file contains two class: UR_BST.java and Binary Tree.java. Binary Tree.java extends UR_BST, so it inherits all methods in UR_BST. 
In the Binary Tree.java, it first creates a UR_Node class, which refers to each node in the Binary Search Tree. And then, it has 11 methods in total, including delete, put, contain, get, traverse, etc. 
In the iterable method, the program traverse the binary tree using queue. In the iterator method, I use the reference from GeeksforGeeks (link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-forward-iterator-in-bst/) to implement.
